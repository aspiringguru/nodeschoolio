why is b undefined at line 18? <br>
Output from line 22 shows b=12 within foo and prior to calling bar.<br>
a variable declared in foo should be a global variable when viewed by bar, since bar is declared inside foo.<br>



<script>
var a=4;
console.log("before foo : a="+a);//a=4, b &c are undefined at this point & throw runtime errors if called.

function foo(){
	console.log("start of foo : a="+a+" b="+b);//a=4, b=undefined.
	var b=a*3;
	console.log("foo : after b=a*3 : a="+a+" b="+b);//a=4, b=12 (4*3)
	function bar(c){
		//NB: bar is called near end of foo, watch order of output.
		//NBB: b is defined within foo - refer 'var b=12' (a*3=4*3=12) above.
		//NBB: c=12 (c=b*4=12*4=48). odd that b is undefined in output while c has a value !!!
		console.log("@ start of bar : a="+a+" b="+b+", c="+c);//a=4, b=undefined, c=48
		var b=2;
		console.log("bar after b=2 : a="+a+" b="+b+", c="+c);//a=4, b=2, c=48
	}
	console.log("in foo after bar: a="+a+" b="+b);//a=4, b=12. c=undefined & runtime error if called.
	bar(b*4);
	console.log("end of foo : a="+a+" b="+b);//a=4, b=12
}
foo();
